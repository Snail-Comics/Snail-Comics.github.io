<p>Mal thought idly that he might be working too much, as he tried to wipe some of the blood off his face. All he managed to do was make it worse, spread the slightly tacky substance further across pale freckled skin, hands soaked much more thoroughly. Honestly most of him was pretty coated in a nauseating miasma of bodily fluids, the very air reeking of metal and meat. His hair was sticking to his skin in places, long, messy black waves clumped in chunks, and he could even feel where something had gotten under the leather patch covering his missing right eye.
   <br><br>Ugh.
    <br><br>Mal typically liked his job, loved working. He got to do things his own way without someone breathing down his neck about it, the job paid well, and the actual surgical work was interesting. It was all very illegal, sure, but they’d carved out a comfortable network to work within. It normally wasn’t this bad, or this messy, but the new guy they’d brought in somehow nicked a major artery, and, well, it had been a panicked race after that to get everything they needed out, viable and ready for transport.
    <br><br>Sloppy. Even working with an idiot he would normally handle a mistake like that better. Mal was good at his job, commanded the scalpel with deft ease, knew the human body backwards and forwards, inside and out, had been doing this for years and never lost an organ that started healthy. Stifling the bleed should have been easy, but lethargy and complacency had been gnawing at the back of his brain, and he’d been slower to react than he should have been.
    <br><br>He also should have noticed the other glaring issue sooner.
    <br><br>The new guy walked over to the last cooler as the few others who’d been working with them filed out of the room, reached to pick it up, and was stopped by a vice grip on his arm. The hand felt vile, tacky red layered over unyielding fingers. Mal didn’t let up when the man winced, or when he turned to flash a nervous grin over his shoulder.
    <br><br>“Uh, sorry about that. I know I messed up, but I’ll get this delivered quick, and-“
    <br><br>“And where is that going?”
    <br><br>The man blinked, offered a nervous laugh, and tried to pull his arm out of Mal’s grip, failing miserably. It was hard to see Mal’s face in the scarce light the room offered, their back turned to the only real light source, an ancient surgical lamp that had clearly gone too long without being wiped down. Even the light of the hall faded out as the door slipped shut, leaving the two alone.
    <br><br>“I’ll need to double check before I get to the car, obviously,”the man offered,”You know that was some technique you have, never seen a surgeon work without gloves-“
    <br><br>Mal sighed, took advantage of his own height to twist the man's arm up painfully over his head.
    <br><br>“OW- Hey! Stop!-“
    <br><br>Mal cut him off, voice flat,“Look, I’ve been working for days now. I really don’t have the patience for this. Just tell me what you’re actually doing here and-“
    <br><br>In a flash, a blink of the eye, the man had moved his free hand to his waistband, pulled a gun from its holster, leveled it at Mal’s face, and pulled the trigger.
    <br><br>An ear-splitting bang ripped through the room.
    <br><br>The man laughed as adrenaline spiked.
    <br><br>“Ha! Boss said you’d be hard to take out, but- but you…“
    <br><br>He trailed off. Stopped. Squinted, and shook his head against the ringing in his ears. The old surgical lamp left Mal a shadow in his gaze, a silhouette back-lit in dingy orange. The shot should have landed, couldn’t possibly have missed, but, no, something was wrong. The grip on his arm hadn’t let up at all. Mal wasn’t falling to the ground, and the gap where his face had been was- was-
    <br><br>Moving.
    <br><br>Mal’s dull green eye blinked down at him.

    <br><br>His head was in two pieces, split down the middle, eye-patch fallen to the floor, and in place of the expected gunshot wound was a pulsing gap of thick black slime.
    <br><br>That gap ripped further open, down Mal’s neck, opening like the expectant jaws of a Venus flytrap as teeth grew in jagged clusters along the edges forming a great mouth, remnants of human form fading to one great dark mass. More of that sickly light poured through as the new mouth opened wide, shone in diseased hues against newly formed eyes, roiling worm-like masses beneath the skin, glistening wet canines and molars where none should ever be.
    <br><br>The man didn’t have a chance to scream before slim black tentacles rushed from the depths of that maw, gripped the sides of his face, and pulled him in with a jerk before biting down with a soft, wet crunch.
        <br><br>Mal dropped the body. It fell with an uneventful thump, and he nudged it away by kicking at it with his boot as his face stitched itself back together, winding black goo stretching, writhing, pulling everything back into its proper place before smoothing over and fading back to muscle, bone, normal pale, freckled skin.
        <br><br>Paranoid suspicion paid off, he supposed. It was helpful being able to just move his entire brain out of the way when he thought someone might be itching to shoot him, gently looked after in the tar-like slurry that bubbled beneath his skin, ready, waiting. He took a moment to make sure everything was basically back where it was supposed to be, made sure he looked normal, and stooped down to pull his eye patch out from under the corpse.
        <br><br>Mal frowned as he tried to shake the worst of the floor dust and blood off it.
        <br><br>Nobody around meant he’d been able to use his more eldritch abilities to make that a lot easier. It unfortunately also meant he needed to quickly clean up, and deliver that last organ cooler himself.
        <br><br>God he was ready to go home.
