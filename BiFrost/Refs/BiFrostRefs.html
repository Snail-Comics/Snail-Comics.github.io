              <p class="card-text">Mal is a largely off-putting, socially stunted, black-market organ harvester. He's incredibly good at his job, skilled in medicine, and strong enough to deal with the inevitable risks that come from a life lived on the edge of society, a combination that's largely lead to him also being a neurotic, awkward mess. Blunt, and unnerving to be around, can all of the horrific aura and persistently gross presentation be blamed on his occupation, or is something more sinister bleeding through-</p>

              <p class="card-text">Known locally as "The Psychic" (complete with capital 'T' and 'P' to match his showman persona), Cain is the sole owner of The Hourglass, a small shop located in Marrow that is chock full of mystic and magic wares-- and his personal psychic services. Unbeknownst to the general public, however, his act as a psychic is just that: an act. He has not a single iota of psychic power; everything he passes off as psychic abilities is either smoke and mirrors, observation, sleight of hand, misdirection, cold & hot reading, or just plain theatrics.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The worgen are a species of wolflike humanoids with animal intelligence and instincts. Long ago, humans tried to domesticate them, and after ages of animal husbandry and eugenics programming, the current iteration of this species now possess human intelligence. However, modern worgen exist in a nebulous cultural space where they are too feral to live peacefully with other sentient beings but lack the training to survive in the wild with their natural kin. 
               <br><br> As one of these worgen, Lyra is her own worst enemy. While she enjoys the thrill of the hunt, she must constantly rein herself in from going too far into her instincts. Lyra has no interest in the Bifrost Terminal and wants nothing more than to return to the Foundry for what was promised to her.</p>
